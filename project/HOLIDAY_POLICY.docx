Holiday Policy & Entitlement Calculation Guide

OVERVIEW
This document explains how holiday entitlements are calculated for all employees in our organization. The system automatically calculates holiday entitlements based on UK statutory requirements and our company policy.

BASIC HOLIDAY POLICY

Statutory Entitlement
• All employees are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid holiday leave per year
• Maximum of 28 days (this is the legal maximum)
• 1 day = 12 hours of work
• Holidays are allocated each financial year (6th April to 5th April)

Key Rules
1. No Carry Over: All holiday days must be used before the end of the financial year (5th April)
2. Lost Holidays: Any unused holiday at the end of the financial year will be lost
3. Bank Holidays: Treated as ordinary working days and paid at standard rate
4. Overtime Bonus: Additional holiday entitlement is accrued for any overtime worked
5. Proportional Usage: Holiday usage is proportional to your contracted working pattern

HOW HOLIDAY ENTITLEMENT IS CALCULATED

Step 1: Determine Your Working Days
First, we need to figure out how many days you work per week:

Example: If you work 36 hours per week:
• 36 hours ÷ 12 hours per day = 3 days per week

Step 2: Calculate Annual Holiday Days
Multiply your working days by 5.6:

Example: 3 days × 5.6 = 16.8 days
• Result = 16.8 days per year (precise calculation)

Step 3: Convert to Hours
Multiply days by 12 hours:

Example: 16.8 days × 12 hours = 201.6 hours per year

FINANCIAL YEAR SYSTEM

When Holidays Reset
• Start Date: 6th April each year
• End Date: 5th April the following year
• Reset: All holiday entitlements are renewed on 6th April

Example Timeline
Financial Year 2024-2025: 6th April 2024 → 5th April 2025
Financial Year 2025-2026: 6th April 2025 → 5th April 2026

DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT SCENARIOS

1. Full-Time Employee (Full Financial Year)
Scenario: You work the entire financial year (6th April to 5th April)

Example: 
• Contract: 36 hours/week (3 days)
• Working period: Full year
• Calculation: 3 days × 5.6 = 16.8 days
• Result: 16.8 days (201.6 hours) holiday entitlement

2. Part-Year Employee (Pro-Rata)
Scenario: You join or leave during the financial year

Example: 
• Contract: 36 hours/week (3 days)
• Start date: 12th September 2024
• End date: Still employed
• Working period: 7 months out of 12

Calculation:
1. Full entitlement: 3 days × 5.6 = 16.8 days
2. Months worked: 7 months
3. Pro-rata calculation: 16.8 days × (7 ÷ 12) = 9.8 days
4. Result: 9.8 days (117.6 hours)

3. Employee Leaving Mid-Year
Scenario: You leave before the end of the financial year

Example:
• Contract: 36 hours/week (3 days)
• Start date: 6th April 2024
• End date: 20th August 2024
• Working period: 4.5 months

Calculation:
1. Full entitlement: 3 days × 5.6 = 16.8 days
2. Months worked: 4.5 months
3. Pro-rata calculation: 16.8 days × (4.5 ÷ 12) = 6.3 days
4. Result: 6.3 days (75.6 hours)

4. Zero-Hour Contract Employee
Scenario: You work variable hours with no fixed contract

Calculation: Based on actual hours worked in the current financial year
• Formula: (Actual hours worked ÷ 12) × 5.6
• Example: If you worked 1,200 hours in the year
  - Days worked: 1,200 ÷ 12 = 100 days
  - Holiday entitlement: 100 × 5.6 = 560 hours (46.7 days)
  - Result: 46.7 days (560 hours)

HOLIDAY USAGE RULES

How Holiday Days Are Used
Important: Holiday usage is based on your normal working pattern, not calendar days.

Example: If you normally work 3 days per week:
• Taking a 7-day holiday = 3 holiday days used (not 7)
• Taking Monday-Thursday off = 2 holiday days used
• Taking Friday-Sunday off = 1 holiday day used

Partial Week Holidays
If you use holiday for part of a week, you only use the proportion of your normal contracted hours.

Example: 
• Normal pattern: 3 shifts per week
• Holiday: Monday-Thursday (4 calendar days)
• Holiday used: 2 days (proportion of your 3-day week)
• Remaining work: 1 shift possible Friday-Sunday

AUTOMATIC CALCULATIONS

What the System Does Automatically
1. Calculates entitlements based on your contract and employment dates
2. Tracks usage from holiday shifts in the system
3. Updates remaining holidays in real-time
4. Handles pro-rata calculations for part-year employment
5. Renews entitlements at the start of each financial year
6. Accounts for overtime in zero-hour contracts

When Calculations Update
• Employment changes: Start/end dates, contract hours
• Holiday requests: When you book time off
• Financial year end: Automatic renewal on 6th April
• Shift changes: For zero-hour contract workers

UNDERSTANDING YOUR HOLIDAY ENTITLEMENT

What You'll See in the System
• Days Entitled: Total holiday days for the financial year
• Hours Entitled: Total holiday hours for the financial year
• Days Taken: How many holiday days you've used
• Hours Taken: How many holiday hours you've used
• Days Remaining: How many holiday days you have left
• Hours Remaining: How many holiday hours you have left

└── Hours Remaining: 141.6 hours

COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: What if I work overtime?
A: For zero-hour contracts, overtime increases your holiday entitlement. For fixed contracts, overtime doesn't affect your basic entitlement.

Q: Can I carry over unused holidays?
A: No, all holidays must be used by 5th April each year. Unused holidays are lost.

Q: What about bank holidays?
A: Bank holidays are treated as normal working days and are included in your 5.6 weeks entitlement.

Q: How is pro-rata calculated?
A: The system calculates the exact number of months you worked and applies that proportion to your full entitlement.

Q: What if I change my contract hours mid-year?
A: The system will recalculate your entitlement based on the new contract and the time remaining in the financial year.

TECHNICAL NOTES
